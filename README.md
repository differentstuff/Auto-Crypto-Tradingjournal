# Trading Journal

> **Disclaimer:** This project was entirely vibe-coded with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and has not been reviewed by professional developers or security experts. Use at your own risk. Contributions and code reviews are very welcome.

A self-hosted crypto futures trading journal with live Bitget API sync, AI-powered trade call analysis, and deep performance analytics. Runs on a Raspberry Pi (or any Linux box) and is accessible from any browser on your local network.

---

## Features

### Trade Journal
- Full trade history synced automatically from Bitget (USDT-M Futures)
- Import historical data via Bitget CSV export
- Filter by symbol, direction, date range, win/loss
- Edit analyst, notes, and tags on any trade — including old ones
- Manual trade entry for other exchanges or paper trades

### Dashboard
- KPIs: total P&L, win rate, profit factor, average trade, best/worst trade
- Cumulative P&L curve and wallet balance history
- Account equity and available balance (live from Bitget)

### Deep Dive Analytics
- P&L breakdown by symbol, month, day of week, and open hour
- Long vs Short comparison
- Trade duration breakdown
- Useful for spotting patterns in your trading behaviour

### AI Call Analyzer (Claude-powered)
- Paste an analyst's trade call → Claude extracts entry, SL, TP levels, scores the setup, and gives a full briefing
- Optionally attach a chart screenshot for vision analysis
- Saves calls with setup score, R:R, trade type, entry timing grade
- Records outcomes (TP1/TP2 hit, SL hit, manual close) to build a track record
- Per-analyst performance stats: win rate, avg PnL, TP hit rate, score accuracy

### Pending Limits / Shadow Trades
- Track limit orders placed on Bitget that aren't in the journal yet
- Live feed of open Bitget limit orders pulled from the API
- Link limits to analyst calls
- Bulk operations: set SL/TP, link to call, cancel all selected
- Auto-matches triggered limits to journal entries

### Live Positions
- Real-time open positions with unrealised P&L, duration, margin details
- Per-position AI analysis: trade quality, invalidation level, suggested actions
- Pending orders panel (entry limits and exit TP/SL orders)
- **📊 Chart button** on every position — opens a detached, resizable chart window

### Chart Explorer
- New dedicated module: type any symbol to draw a candlestick chart with full TA
- **S/R detection**: swing-pivot clustering shows horizontal grey zones — heavier-tested levels are visibly darker
- **Trendline detection**: ascending support lines and descending resistance lines drawn as dashed diagonals
- **Liquidation levels**: yellow dashed lines showing where open positions get liquidated (auto-detected from live positions)
- **Technical indicator panel**: RSI, MACD, EMA stack, Bollinger Bands, ADX, Stoch RSI, ATR, Volume — shown as metric cards below the chart
- **Pop Out button**: open any chart as a separate resizable window
- Timeframe switcher: 15m / 1H / 4H / 1D

### Auto-Sync
- Background sync every 5 minutes from Bitget API
- Cursor-based position pagination — catches trades regardless of how long they were held open
- Startup catch-up window to recover trades missed during downtime
- Idempotent: safe to sync repeatedly, no duplicates

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3 / Flask 3.1 |
| Database | SQLite (via Python `sqlite3`) |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS SPA (single `index.html`, no build step) |
| Dashboard charts | Chart.js |
| Candlestick charts | LightweightCharts v4.1.3 (TradingView) |
| Technical analysis | pandas-ta |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6` / vision) |
| Exchange API | Bitget REST API v2 |
| Process manager | systemd |

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com) account with API access (read-only keys are sufficient)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) for the AI features
- Linux host (tested on Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anvilfilbert/Auto-Crypto-Tradingjournal.git
cd Auto-Crypto-Tradingjournal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
BITGET_API_KEY=your_api_key
BITGET_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BITGET_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase
PORT=8082
```

The Anthropic API key is set separately — the app reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment or you can add it to `.env`.

### Bitget API key setup

1. Log in to Bitget → **Profile → API Management → Create API**
2. Permissions needed: **Read** only (the journal never places or cancels orders)
3. Copy the API Key, Secret Key, and Passphrase into `.env`

---

## Running

### Directly

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The app starts on `http://0.0.0.0:8082` (or the port set in `.env`).

### As a systemd service (recommended)

Copy the included service file and enable it:

```bash
sudo cp trading-journal.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now trading-journal
```

The service uses `EnvironmentFile=` to load `.env` and restarts automatically on failure.

---

## First run

1. Open `http://<your-host>:8082` in a browser
2. Go to **Import** and upload a Bitget CSV export to populate historical trades
3. The background sync will start automatically and keep the journal up to date from that point on
4. Use **Call Analyzer** to start logging analyst calls before you enter trades

## Notes

- The journal is designed for personal use on a local network. There is no authentication layer — do not expose it to the public internet without adding one.
- All AI features require a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The journal works without it — the AI buttons will simply return an error.
- SQLite is sufficient for personal use (one user, <100k trades). No migration to Postgres is needed.

## Changelog

### v2.1 — AI Accuracy, Performance & Code Quality

#### AI Accuracy
- **Multi-TF confluence scoring** — `confluence_score()` in `chart_context.py` aggregates RSI/MACD/EMA/ADX direction signals across timeframes; injected as a single CONFLUENCE line in every AI prompt
- **ATR-aware SL check** — call analyzer and limit analyzer warn when the stop-loss distance is smaller than the 1H ATR noise floor (< 0.5× ATR = "inside noise"; < 1× ATR = "tight stop")
- **Portfolio correlation check** — call analyzer detects same-sector/same-direction concentration across open positions (6 named sectors: BTC, ETH/L2, SOL/L1, Meme, DeFi, AI/Infra)
- **Richer score calibration** — `get_calibration_for_prompt()` now shows entry rate per score tier alongside TP1/SL outcome rates and an actionable verdict (→ ENTER / → SKIP)
- **Shared prompt builder** — `prompt_builder.py` assembles rulebook + calibration + chart context + similar trades into a budget-capped context block (5 600 chars ≈ 1 400 tokens), used by all four AI modules
- **Stats pruning** — `ai_advisor.py` strips empty arrays, caps `by_symbol` to top 10, caps `by_hour` to the 8 most-differentiated hours before serialising to the prompt (~30% size reduction)
- **Compact chart format** — `format_for_prompt()` rewritten from ~15 lines per TF to one dense line (e.g. `BTCUSDT 4H: RSI 58(neu) | MACD bull | EMA ↑all | ADX 28↑ | ATR 1.2%`)

#### Performance
- **No double indicator computation** — `confluence_score()` now accepts a pre-computed `ctx` dict; `prompt_builder` passes the already-fetched result, avoiding a second round of `pandas-ta` per timeframe per request
- **Parallel ATR + market context** — `ai_call.py` and `ai_limit.py` fetch the 1H ATR chart and market context (fear/greed + funding) concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **`detect_all_trendlines()`** runs all 4 TF fetches (1W/1D/4H/1H) concurrently — ~4× faster chart loads
- **`get_chart_context()`** parallelises multi-TF indicator computation the same way
- **Thread-safe caches** — `chart_context.py` and `routes/market.py` price cache both protected by `threading.Lock`

#### New AI modules
- **`ai_call.py`** — call analysis core split from `ai_call_analyzer.py`; fixes a `setup_type` NameError bug from the original
- **`ai_limit.py`** — pending limit analysis, previously missing and causing 500 errors
- **`ai_call_analyzer.py`** — converted to a 3-line re-export shim for backward compatibility
- **`trade_utils.py`** — shared `SECTORS` dict and `atr_sl_warning()` extracted from duplicated private copies; sectors synced with JS (MOGUSDT, POPCATUSDT, COMPUSDT added)
- **`helpers.strip_fence()`** — single canonical markdown-fence stripper replaces 5 duplicated inline blocks; fixes a buggy variant in `ai_advisor.py` and a weaker one in `ai_rulebook.py`

#### New route: `routes/market.py`
- Market context, economic calendar, exchange symbols, and mark prices split out of `routes/analytics.py` into their own Blueprint

#### UX & Charts
- **Multi-TF trendlines** — `detect_all_trendlines()` fetches 1W/1D/4H/1H; visual weight system (heavier/more opaque = higher timeframe); real-time slope extension using price-per-second so weekly lines display correctly on 15m charts
- **Live trade chart levels** — `openChart()` passes entry, SL, TP1, TP2 as URL params; `chart.html` renders each as a `createPriceLine()` with colour coding and legend chips showing % distance from mark
- **Searchable symbol picker** — live-filter dropdown on every coin input (Chart Explorer, Add Trade, Log Manual Trade); two-variant architecture (absolute vs fixed) handles modal `overflow:hidden` clipping
- **Cross-page awareness** — open position cards show `⏳ N limit(s)` chip when waiting limits exist; clicking navigates to Pending Orders
- **Proximity alerts** — limits within 5% of current mark price show `📍 X.X% from limit` badge (red/yellow/blue thresholds)
- **Chart Explorer title overlay** — coin name and active timeframe shown as a top-left overlay; updates on every draw/TF switch
- **Mouseover tooltips** — all Dashboard KPIs, Live Trades KPIs, and Chart Explorer indicator cards have `data-tip` explanations
- **JavaScript split** — `static/app.js` split into 14 focused files under `static/js/`
- **Dashboard parallel fetch** — `loadDashboard()` fires KPI + market context + live positions in a single `Promise.all`

#### Bug fixes
- `setup_type` NameError in original `ai_call_analyzer.py` — variable referenced before assignment
- `analyze_pending_limit()` function was missing — route called it but it was never implemented
- DB connection leak in three AI modules — `get_conn()` without context manager leaked write-lock on any exception

---

### v2.0 — Interactive Charts & S/R Intelligence

#### Detached Chart Window
- **`📊 Chart` button** on every live position card — opens a resizable, detached chart window (`window.open`) instead of a cramped in-page modal
- Chart window is reused per symbol — clicking the same coin a second time focuses the existing window rather than opening a new one
- Timeframe switcher (15m / 1H / 4H / 1D) inside the chart window — reload in place without reopening

#### S/R Detection
- **Swing-pivot clustering** (`detect_support_resistance()` in `chart_context.py`) — identifies local highs/lows, clusters nearby pivots, and counts touches per level
- **Grey box rendering**: S/R levels are drawn as horizontal filled rectangles on a `<canvas>` overlay — opacity scales with touch count (lighter = fewer touches, darker = more tested)
- **Right-axis labels**: each level shows type (`S`/`R`) and touch count directly on the price axis
- S/R summary injected into all AI prompts (live position analysis, call analyzer) via `format_for_prompt()`

#### Trendline Detection
- **`detect_trendlines()`** in `chart_context.py` — finds ascending support lines and descending resistance lines using swing-pivot pairs; validates each pair (no candle violates the line within 0.5% tolerance)
- Up to 2 uptrend + 2 downtrend lines per chart
- Trendlines drawn as dashed diagonal lines: green for uptrend, red for downtrend
- Legend shows direction, touch count, and anchor price range

#### Liquidation Levels
- **Yellow dashed lines** on every chart showing where each open position would be liquidated
- Auto-populated from live positions data; passed to the chart window as URL params
- Labels show direction (Long/Short) and exact liquidation price

#### Chart Explorer (new nav module)
- **Dedicated page** — type any symbol, pick a timeframe, click Draw to render a full candlestick chart
- All S/R, trendlines, and liquidation overlays from live positions apply automatically
- **Indicator panel** below the chart: RSI, MACD signal, EMA stack alignment, Bollinger %B, ADX, Stoch RSI, ATR, Volume ratio — shown as metric cards with colour-coded values
- **Pop Out** button opens the current chart as a detached resizable window
- Symbol autocomplete populated from your full trade history

#### Canvas Overlay Architecture
- S/R boxes and liquidation lines rendered on an absolutely-positioned `<canvas>` on top of LightweightCharts — stays in sync with pan/zoom via `requestAnimationFrame` loop
- Loop auto-stops when the canvas is removed from the DOM (chart destroyed / TF switch)
- Price-scale area (right ~65px) deliberately left uncovered so axis labels remain readable

---

### v1.9 — Technical Analysis & AI Foundation
- **`chart_context.py`** — new module: pulls OHLCV candles from Bitget and computes a full indicator suite via `pandas-ta` (no extra API key needed — uses existing Bitget auth)
- **Indicators computed per symbol × timeframe**: RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9), EMA 20/50/200 + stack alignment, Bollinger Bands(20,2) with percentile position, Stochastic RSI(14), ADX(14) with +DI/−DI direction, ATR(14) as % of price, volume vs 20-period average, last 3 candle descriptions (bullish/bearish/doji)
- **Auto-injected into Live Position AI** (4H + 1D) — Claude now references indicators when recommending Hold / Adjust SL / Close Now
- **Auto-injected into Call Analyzer** (4H + 1D) — Claude cross-references the call with live technicals before scoring
- **10-minute in-memory cache** per (symbol, timeframe) — no repeated Bitget calls within a session
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/chart/indicators?symbol=BTCUSDT&timeframes=4H,1D`
- **`docs/RATING_CRITERIA.md`** — complete reference documenting every AI scoring and grading criterion used across all six systems
- **Bug fix**: `analyze_call()` missing `market_regime` parameter caused 500 error on every call analysis request
- `pandas` and `pandas-ta` added to `requirements.txt`
- **`ai_rulebook.py`** — new module: Claude analyses your entire trade history and synthesises 5–10 personalised rules (warnings, strengths, habits, calibration notes) backed by real numbers from your data
- **`trader_rulebook` DB table** — rules persisted in SQLite; auto-regenerated weekly by the background sync loop
- **Rulebook + calibration data + similar trades** injected into every AI prompt (live position analysis, call analyzer, AI advisor)
- **Edge Lab UI** — "Trader Rulebook" section with Generate/Update button; rules displayed as colour-coded cards with confidence level and trade count
- **New API endpoints**: `GET /api/rulebook`, `POST /api/rulebook/update`

### v1.8 — Architecture Refactor
- **Flask Blueprints** — `app.py` reduced from 1158 to 52 lines; all routes split into `routes/` by domain: `journal`, `analytics`, `calls`, `limits`, `live`, `sync`
- **`db_conn()` context manager** — every route now uses `with db_conn() as conn:`, guaranteeing connection close on exception. Added to `database.py`
- **CSS extracted** — `templates/index.html` no longer contains inline CSS; all styles moved to `static/style.css` (cacheable, easier to edit)
- **Shared helpers** — `helpers.py` provides `_ok()`, `_err()`, `_filters_from_args()` to all blueprints
- **`analyst` migration consolidated** — moved from `app.py` startup into `database.py → init_db()` with all other column migrations

### v1.7 — Trading Tools & Heatmap
- **Position Sizing Calculator** — inline in Call Analyzer: enter Entry + SL, risk % auto-populates from account equity, shows Position Size / Leverage / Risk Amount / Risk Distance. Auto-fills entry and SL after every call analysis.
- **Economic Calendar** — fetches this week's high-impact USD events (ForexFactory, no API key). Yellow warning banner on Live Positions when events fall today or tomorrow. 
- **Trade Heatmap** — 7×24 grid in Deep Dive showing win rate by open hour (UTC) and close day. Color-coded: green ≥65% · blue 50–64% · yellow 40–49% · red <40%. Cells need ≥3 trades to activate.
- **BTC Dominance** — added to Dashboard Market Pulse strip via CoinGecko free API. Rising dominance shown in red (bad for alts), falling in green.

### v1.6 — Market Intelligence & Strategy
- **Fear & Greed Index** — live 0-100 sentiment score from alternative.me shown in a Market Pulse strip on the Dashboard
- **Bitget Funding Rate** — per-symbol, shown as chip on every Live Positions card; injected into per-position Claude analysis
- **Bitget Long/Short Ratio** — retail positioning per symbol on Live Positions cards; injected into analysis
- All three sources feed Claude's trade grading, per-position analysis, and full AI Advisor
- New module `market_context.py` with 5-minute in-memory cache; new `GET /api/market/context?symbols=` endpoint

- **Correlation Detector** — groups open positions by sector (Bitcoin / ETH+L2 / SOL+L1 / Meme / DeFi / AI+Infra); two-tier severity: yellow (2 positions same sector/direction), red (3+)
- **AI Pattern Detector** — Claude analyses full trade history by setup type, session, weekday, direction, duration, grade; returns warnings, insights, and strengths

### v1.5 — Trading Precision & Edge Lab
- **AI Execution Grading** — click ⚡ Grade on any trade; Claude assigns A/B/C/D with a written explanation based on entry quality, exit discipline, and realized R:R
- **Setup Type Tagging** — label trades as Breakout, Pullback, Trend Continuation, Range Fade, Reversal, News/Event, or Other; Deep Dive shows P&L and win rate broken down by setup type
- **Planned vs Realized R:R** — link a trade to an analyst call; Deep Dive computes and displays planned R:R vs what was actually achieved
- **Edge Lab** — Deep Dive split into two pages; Edge Lab adds setup analysis, grade breakdown, pattern detector, R:R tracking
- **Setup Type filter in Journal** — filter by specific setup or ⚪ Untagged; setup captured in Add Trade modal for manual trades
- New backend module `ai_trade_grader.py`; new API routes `POST /api/positions/<id>/grade` and `GET /api/analytics/rr`

### v1.4 — Code Quality & Security
- `SECURITY.md` added — lightweight vulnerability reporting policy via GitHub private advisories
- CodeQL workflow added (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) — analysis now actually runs on push, PR, and weekly; branch protection is fully operational
- Frontend JS extracted from `templates/index.html` into `static/app.js` — `index.html` reduced from 3348 to 1078 lines
- Security fix: incomplete string escaping in `static/app.js` — backslashes now escaped before single quotes in analyst name interpolation (CWE-116)
