## Features

### Trade Journal
- Full trade history synced automatically from Bitget (USDT-M Futures)
- Import historical data via Bitget CSV export
- Filter by symbol, direction, date range, win/loss
- Edit analyst, notes, and tags on any trade — including old ones
- Manual trade entry for other exchanges or paper trades

### Dashboard
- KPIs: total P&L, win rate, profit factor, average trade, best/worst trade
- Cumulative P&L curve and wallet balance history
- Account equity and available balance (live from Bitget)

### Deep Dive Analytics
- P&L breakdown by symbol, month, day of week, and open hour
- Long vs Short comparison
- Trade duration breakdown
- Useful for spotting patterns in your trading behaviour

### AI Call Analyzer (Claude-powered)
- Paste an analyst's trade call → Claude extracts entry, SL, TP levels, scores the setup, and gives a full briefing
- Optionally attach a chart screenshot for vision analysis
- Saves calls with setup score, R:R, trade type, entry timing grade
- Records outcomes (TP1/TP2 hit, SL hit, manual close) to build a track record
- Per-analyst performance stats: win rate, avg PnL, TP hit rate, score accuracy

### Pending Limits / Shadow Trades
- Track limit orders placed on Bitget that aren't in the journal yet
- Live feed of open Bitget limit orders pulled from the API
- Link limits to analyst calls
- Bulk operations: set SL/TP, link to call, cancel all selected

### Live Positions
- Real-time open positions with unrealised P&L, duration, margin details
- Per-position AI analysis: trade quality, invalidation level, suggested actions
- Pending orders panel (entry limits and exit TP/SL orders)
- **📊 Chart button** on every position — opens a detached, resizable chart window

### Chart Explorer
- New dedicated module: type any symbol to draw a candlestick chart with full TA
- **S/R detection**: swing-pivot clustering shows horizontal grey zones — heavier-tested levels are visibly darker
- **Trendline detection**: ascending support lines and descending resistance lines drawn as dashed diagonals
- **Liquidation levels**: yellow dashed lines showing where open positions get liquidated (auto-detected from live positions)
- **Technical indicator panel**: RSI, MACD, EMA stack, Bollinger Bands, ADX, Stoch RSI, ATR, Volume — shown as metric cards below the chart
- **Pop Out button**: open any chart as a separate resizable window
- Timeframe switcher: 15m / 1H / 4H / 1D

### Auto-Sync
- Background sync every 5 minutes from Bitget API
- Cursor-based position pagination — catches trades regardless of how long they were held open
- Startup catch-up window to recover trades missed during downtime
- Idempotent: safe to sync repeatedly, no duplicates

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3 / Flask 3.1 |
| Database | SQLite (via Python `sqlite3`) |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS SPA (single `index.html`, no build step) |
| Dashboard charts | Chart.js |
| Candlestick charts | LightweightCharts v4.1.3 (TradingView) |
| Technical analysis | pandas-ta |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6` / vision) |
| Exchange API | Bitget REST API v2 |
| Process manager | systemd |

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com) account with API access (read-only keys are sufficient)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) for the AI features
- Linux host (tested on Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anvilfilbert/Auto-Crypto-Tradingjournal.git
cd Auto-Crypto-Tradingjournal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
BITGET_API_KEY=your_api_key
BITGET_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BITGET_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase
PORT=8082
```

The Anthropic API key is set separately — the app reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment or you can add it to `.env`.

### Bitget API key setup

1. Log in to Bitget → **Profile → API Management → Create API**
2. Permissions needed: **Read** only (the journal never places or cancels orders)
3. Copy the API Key, Secret Key, and Passphrase into `.env`

---

## Running

### Directly

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The app starts on `http://0.0.0.0:8082` (or the port set in `.env`).

### As a systemd service (recommended)

Copy the included service file and enable it:

```bash
sudo cp trading-journal.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now trading-journal
```

The service uses `EnvironmentFile=` to load `.env` and restarts automatically on failure.

---

## First run

1. Open `http://<your-host>:8082` in a browser
2. Go to **Import** and upload a Bitget CSV export to populate historical trades
3. The background sync will start automatically and keep the journal up to date from that point on
4. Use **Call Analyzer** to start logging analyst calls before you enter trades

## Notes

- The journal is designed for personal use on a local network. There is no authentication layer — do not expose it to the public internet without adding one.
- All AI features require a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The journal works without it — the AI buttons will simply return an error.
- SQLite is sufficient for personal use (one user, <100k trades). No migration to Postgres is needed.

## Changelog

### v2.5 — Multi-Exchange Support: Bitget + Blofin

#### Blofin Integration
- **`blofin_client.py`** — full authenticated Blofin REST API v1 client (HMAC-SHA256, `ACCESS-KEY / ACCESS-SIGN / ACCESS-TIMESTAMP / ACCESS-NONCE / ACCESS-PASSPHRASE`). Fetches closed position history (cursor-paginated by `historyId`), open positions, and account equity
- **`blofin_sync.py`** — background sync daemon (5-min cadence, 15s startup delay after Bitget). Deduplicates by `historyId`, tags all rows `exchange='blofin'`, stores equity to settings table, calls `_auto_close_calls()` so analyst calls auto-close from Blofin closures
- **Live Trades** — open positions from both Bitget and Blofin shown on the same page
- **Check-Matches** — analyst call matching panel now checks open positions on both exchanges; confirm-match writes `call_id` back to the positions row for R:R analysis
- **Call Analysis** — position sizing uses Bitget equity, falls through to Blofin equity if Bitget is not configured
- **positions table** — new `exchange` column (`'bitget'` | `'blofin'`), new `leverage` column; Blofin trades show a teal exchange badge in the journal

#### ⚙️ Settings Module (new nav page)
- `GET /api/settings/exchanges` — returns masked API key preview + connection status for each exchange
- `POST /api/settings/test-connection` — live connection test (Bitget or Blofin)
- `POST /api/settings/credentials` — write new keys to `.env` + reload in process (no restart needed)
- `POST /api/settings/blofin/sync` — manual Blofin sync trigger with result display
- Inline credential form for editing keys; passphrase sanitised before write
- Live Sync connection panel now shows both exchanges dynamically

#### All / Bitget / Blofin Global Exchange Filter
- Three persistent pills in the **top sync bar** — visible on every page
- Filter applies to: Dashboard KPIs, Deep Dive, Edge Lab, Heatmap, R:R analysis, Pattern Detector, AI Advisor, Hindsight, Journal
- Selection stored in `localStorage` and restored on reload
- Backend: `_filters_from_args()` and `_build_where()` in `analytics.py` propagate the exchange clause to all stat queries automatically

#### Bug Fixes (12 total from code audit)
- `confirm-match` now writes `call_id` to the positions row (was never linked before)
- `_auto_close_calls()` now runs after every Blofin sync, not just Bitget
- Call analysis no longer falls back to fake $1,000 equity when Bitget not configured
- `init_db()` moved outside `__main__` guard — works under gunicorn/WSGI
- Blofin sync pagination now fetches full history on initial back-fill
- Manual sync errors recorded to status; passphrase protected from newline injection

### v2.4 — VMC Cipher A/B, Optimisation Pass & Chart Improvements

#### VMC Cipher A/B — WaveTrend Oscillator
- **`compute_wavetrend()`** in `chart_context.py` — full VuManChu Cipher B formula (n1=10, n2=21), matching TradingView defaults
  - **Cipher A core:** HLC3 → EMA channel → CI normalisation → WT1 (EMA21) + WT2 (SMA4) + histogram
  - **Cipher B addition:** MFI = RSI(HLC3×Volume, 60) rescaled to ±100 for money flow context
  - **Signals:** gold_buy (WT2 < −80 + bullish cross), buy (WT2 < −53 + cross), sell (WT2 > 53 + bearish cross)
- **Scoring integration:** WT is the 6th confluence signal; gold_buy=±1.0, buy=±0.85, sell=∓0.85, position-only scales WT1/60 to ±0.5
- **Prompt context:** `format_for_prompt()` appends WT state: `WT GOLD↑(−82)` / `WT↑XO-OS(−54)` / `WT↓XO-OB(57)` — Claude sees explicit Cipher B context on every analysis
- **Chart pane (130px)** below the candlestick chart in both the detached chart window and Chart Explorer:
  - WT1 teal line (Cipher A), WT2 red line, MFI histogram (Cipher B, background)
  - Reference lines at ±53, ±60, ±80 and zero
  - Signal markers: 🟢 buy circle, 🟡 gold circle, 🔴 sell arrowDown
  - TimeScale synced bi-directionally with main chart
- **VMC Cipher B indicator card** in the Chart Explorer indicator panel

#### Optimisation Pass (16 tasks)

**Scoring & AI Accuracy**
- Confluence signals are now magnitude-weighted — RSI/MACD/EMA/ADX scale by strength (RSI 72 ≠ RSI 51)
- Volume added as a 5th confluence signal: high volume (>1.5×) amplifies directional consensus
- ATR-relative "near a level" definitions quantified in all scoring prompts (≤0.5× ATR = strong, >1× ATR = score cap)
- Funding rate and Fear/Greed penalty rules quantified: funding >0.05% in trade direction = −1 point
- `pattern_flags` added to call analyzer JSON schema (was always undefined — Personal Pattern Warnings never showed)
- Scoring scale labels unified across scanner, hindsight, and SCORING_GUIDE.md (6=Acceptable, 7=Good, etc.)

**Chart Rendering**
- Volume histogram bars (bottom 20% of chart, green/red by candle direction)
- Weekly S/R levels (gold/amber zones) shown on intraday charts — major structure always visible
- Auto-drawn Fibonacci retracements (0–78.6%) from most recent significant swing
- ATR-relative trendline validation tolerance (replaces fixed 0.4%)
- At-risk trendlines rendered amber with ⚠ badge when a candle wick came within 30% of breaching

**S/R Quality**
- Recency-weighted touch counting — exponential decay (λ=0.02) so a level tested last week outranks one tested 6 months ago
- ATR-relative clustering tolerance — scales with instrument volatility instead of fixed 0.4%

**Code Quality**
- Context budget truncation logged to server output when rulebook/calibration is cut
- Hindsight TP/FP/TN/FN verdicts fed back into the calibration block Claude sees on every analysis
- Haiku quick-pass (scanner) now returns a one-sentence rationale; ranked 13–30 setups surfaced with ⚡ badge

---

### v2.3 — Code Audit & Accuracy Fixes

Ten targeted fixes from a full codebase audit. No new features — pure correctness and label clarity.

#### Call Analyzer (`ai_call.py`)
- **Direction detection fixed** — previously defaulted to Short for any call that lacked the word "long". Now detects Short/Sell/Bearish explicitly and defaults to Long, matching how analyst calls are written in practice
- **Symbol extraction expanded** — previously required a `$` prefix (`$BTC`). Now also matches `#SYMBOL`, bare `XXXUSDT`, and a guarded bare-ticker fallback (blocks SL/TP/DCA/USD false positives). Calls without a dollar sign no longer produce `UNKNOWN` symbol, preserving history lookup and correlation checks
- **DCA risk annotation** — sizing output now includes a `risk_note` field clarifying that the 2% DCA risk figure is the total across both entry legs, not per-entry

#### Hindsight Analysis (`ai_hindsight.py`)
- **`ENTER_THRESHOLD` raised 5 → 6** — now matches what the prompt instructs Claude (`score ≥ 6 = ENTER`). Fixes the fallback `would_enter` default when Claude omits the field
- **`direction_match` default corrected** — previously defaulted to `True` when Claude omitted `rec_direction` (SKIP responses). Now defaults to `would_enter`, preventing phantom direction-match credit on skipped trades
- **Docstring corrected** — stated "score 5–6 = neutral" but code correctly treats only score 5 as neutral and score ≥ 6 as ENTER per the prompt

#### Analytics (`analytics.py`)
- **Profit factor on perfect streaks** — returned `None` (displayed as "—") when there were zero losing trades. Now returns `999.0`, rendered as **∞** in the dashboard
- **Duration bucket labels** — clarified to `1h-4h` / `4h-24h` to make the hour boundary unambiguous

#### Chart Context (`chart_context.py`)
- **Confluence thresholds tightened** — "Bullish" label raised from 15% → 33% net signal alignment; "Strong Bullish" from 50% → 60%. Previously a single net signal out of six triggered a directional label that flowed into AI prompts
- **Unified price tolerance** — `PRICE_TOLERANCE = 0.004` shared constant replaces separate 0.3% (S/R clustering) and 0.5% (trendline validation) values, ensuring both algorithms agree on what counts as the same price zone

---

### v2.2 — Setup Scanner, Hindsight Analysis & Scoring Guide

#### Setup Scanner (⭐ new nav page)
- **Proactive opportunity finder** — scans 100 USDT-M futures symbols for trade setups scored 6-10/10 without waiting for analyst calls
- **3-stage pipeline**: (1) multi-TF confluence filter — parallel fetch of 4H+1D signals, passes symbols with ≥2 aligned; (2) technical quality gate — rejects choppy ADX, overextended RSI, missing S/R structure; (3) AI scoring — Claude evaluates finalists with full context, returns only 6-10/10 setups
- **Results table** with columns: score, symbol, direction, confluence summary, chart pattern, entry zone, R:R, urgency
- **Click any row** to expand a detail panel: entry zone + structural rationale, stop loss + ATR distance explanation, TP1 + TP2 each with target level explanation, "Why X/10" score reasoning block, key conditions and risk badges
- **Chart with levels** — opens the detached chart window with entry zone, SL, TP1, TP2 pre-drawn as price lines
- **Results cached 30 min**, Re-scan button for fresh data; 100-symbol watchlist covers BTC/ETH, major L1s, L2s, DeFi, AI, Meme, Gaming, Solana ecosystem

#### Hindsight Analysis (🔮 new nav page)
- **Retroactive blind scoring** — fetches historical Bitget candles at each trade's exact entry time, reconstructs the technical picture as it was at that moment, and asks Claude to score the setup without knowing the outcome
- **Full comparison**: actual P&L vs "following recommendations" P&L (skipping trades Claude would have scored below 5)
- **Signal accuracy** — TP/FP/TN/FN verdicts per trade; accuracy = (TP+TN) / all strong-signal trades
- **Results stored in `trade_hindsight` DB table** — persistent across sessions; re-run at any time for fresh analysis
- **Summary view**: 4-column comparison (Actual | Recommendations | Signal Accuracy | Score vs Outcome) with a key insight line showing P&L difference, win-rate change, and savings from skipped low-quality trades
- **Trade-by-trade table** with score badge, recommendation (ENTER/SKIP), hypothetical P&L, delta, and verdict badge

#### Scoring Guide (`docs/SCORING_GUIDE.md`)
- New standalone reference document: exact criteria for every score level 1-10
- Per-score detailed breakdown with real examples for each level
- Factor grids: confluence, entry quality, SL distance (ATR), R:R benchmarks, RSI at entry, multi-TF alignment
- Common mistakes table (what specific errors cost how many points)
- "What separates a 7 from a 9" section

#### Telegram Alerts + Scheduled Scanner
- **Automatic 30-minute scans** — `scanner_scheduler.py` starts a background daemon thread at app startup, fires `force_scan()` every 30 minutes (first scan 5 min after boot)
- **Telegram notifications** — `telegram_notify.py` sends an HTML-formatted alert when any 6+/10 setup is found; includes symbol, direction, score, entry/SL/TP, R:R, urgency, and a deep-link back to the journal
- **No external dependencies** — uses only `urllib.request` (stdlib)
- **Live Sync page** — new Telegram Alerts section shows configured/unconfigured status and a "Send Test Message" button to verify the connection
- **New API endpoints**: `GET /api/telegram/status`, `POST /api/telegram/test`
- **Config in `.env`**: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `APP_URL`; optional overrides `SCANNER_INTERVAL`, `SCANNER_FIRST_DELAY`, `SCANNER_SCHEDULER=off`

#### Call Analyzer legend
- **"ℹ How to read the results"** collapsible panel on the Call Analyzer page — explains every element in the analysis output: score tiers (1-10 with colour coding), R:R ratio in plain English, DCA, trade types, entry timing, ATR Risk warning, Portfolio Correlation warning, Candle-Close SL and why Bitget can't automate it, Personal Pattern Warnings (yours, not generic), all position sizing terms, Optimizations vs Risks

#### Bug fixes (from code audit)
- `settings` table missing from `init_db()` — `ai_rulebook` crashed on fresh installs
- Malformed regex in `ai_call._extract_price()` — `{0,20}` quantifier was inside character class (wrong) instead of after it
- Scanner Stage 2 passed 86/100 symbols to Claude — tightened ADX/RSI thresholds, added 4H signal check, capped at 30
- `ai_advisor.py` leaked DB connection on exception
- `ai_limit.py` ThreadPoolExecutor `.result()` calls outside the `with` block
- Hindsight lookahead bias in history query fixed

---

### v2.1 — AI Accuracy, Performance & Code Quality

#### AI Accuracy
- **Multi-TF confluence scoring** — `confluence_score()` in `chart_context.py` aggregates RSI/MACD/EMA/ADX direction signals across timeframes; injected as a single CONFLUENCE line in every AI prompt
- **ATR-aware SL check** — call analyzer and limit analyzer warn when the stop-loss distance is smaller than the 1H ATR noise floor (< 0.5× ATR = "inside noise"; < 1× ATR = "tight stop")
- **Portfolio correlation check** — call analyzer detects same-sector/same-direction concentration across open positions (6 named sectors: BTC, ETH/L2, SOL/L1, Meme, DeFi, AI/Infra)
- **Richer score calibration** — `get_calibration_for_prompt()` now shows entry rate per score tier alongside TP1/SL outcome rates and an actionable verdict (→ ENTER / → SKIP)
- **Shared prompt builder** — `prompt_builder.py` assembles rulebook + calibration + chart context + similar trades into a budget-capped context block (5 600 chars ≈ 1 400 tokens), used by all four AI modules
- **Stats pruning** — `ai_advisor.py` strips empty arrays, caps `by_symbol` to top 10, caps `by_hour` to the 8 most-differentiated hours before serialising to the prompt (~30% size reduction)
- **Compact chart format** — `format_for_prompt()` rewritten from ~15 lines per TF to one dense line (e.g. `BTCUSDT 4H: RSI 58(neu) | MACD bull | EMA ↑all | ADX 28↑ | ATR 1.2%`)

#### Performance
- **No double indicator computation** — `confluence_score()` now accepts a pre-computed `ctx` dict; `prompt_builder` passes the already-fetched result, avoiding a second round of `pandas-ta` per timeframe per request
- **Parallel ATR + market context** — `ai_call.py` and `ai_limit.py` fetch the 1H ATR chart and market context (fear/greed + funding) concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **`detect_all_trendlines()`** runs all 4 TF fetches (1W/1D/4H/1H) concurrently — ~4× faster chart loads
- **`get_chart_context()`** parallelises multi-TF indicator computation the same way
- **Thread-safe caches** — `chart_context.py` and `routes/market.py` price cache both protected by `threading.Lock`

#### New AI modules
- **`ai_call.py`** — call analysis core split from `ai_call_analyzer.py`; fixes a `setup_type` NameError bug from the original
- **`ai_limit.py`** — pending limit analysis, previously missing and causing 500 errors
- **`ai_call_analyzer.py`** — converted to a 3-line re-export shim for backward compatibility
- **`trade_utils.py`** — shared `SECTORS` dict and `atr_sl_warning()` extracted from duplicated private copies; sectors synced with JS (MOGUSDT, POPCATUSDT, COMPUSDT added)
- **`helpers.strip_fence()`** — single canonical markdown-fence stripper replaces 5 duplicated inline blocks; fixes a buggy variant in `ai_advisor.py` and a weaker one in `ai_rulebook.py`

#### New route: `routes/market.py`
- Market context, economic calendar, exchange symbols, and mark prices split out of `routes/analytics.py` into their own Blueprint

#### UX & Charts
- **Multi-TF trendlines** — `detect_all_trendlines()` fetches 1W/1D/4H/1H; visual weight system (heavier/more opaque = higher timeframe); real-time slope extension using price-per-second so weekly lines display correctly on 15m charts
- **Live trade chart levels** — `openChart()` passes entry, SL, TP1, TP2 as URL params; `chart.html` renders each as a `createPriceLine()` with colour coding and legend chips showing % distance from mark
- **Searchable symbol picker** — live-filter dropdown on every coin input (Chart Explorer, Add Trade, Log Manual Trade); two-variant architecture (absolute vs fixed) handles modal `overflow:hidden` clipping
- **Cross-page awareness** — open position cards show `⏳ N limit(s)` chip when waiting limits exist; clicking navigates to Pending Orders
- **Proximity alerts** — limits within 5% of current mark price show `📍 X.X% from limit` badge (red/yellow/blue thresholds)
- **Chart Explorer title overlay** — coin name and active timeframe shown as a top-left overlay; updates on every draw/TF switch
- **Mouseover tooltips** — all Dashboard KPIs, Live Trades KPIs, and Chart Explorer indicator cards have `data-tip` explanations
- **JavaScript split** — `static/app.js` split into 14 focused files under `static/js/`
- **Dashboard parallel fetch** — `loadDashboard()` fires KPI + market context + live positions in a single `Promise.all`

#### Bug fixes
- `setup_type` NameError in original `ai_call_analyzer.py` — variable referenced before assignment
- `analyze_pending_limit()` function was missing — route called it but it was never implemented
- DB connection leak in three AI modules — `get_conn()` without context manager leaked write-lock on any exception

---

### v2.0 — Interactive Charts & S/R Intelligence

#### Detached Chart Window
- **`📊 Chart` button** on every live position card — opens a resizable, detached chart window (`window.open`) instead of a cramped in-page modal
- Chart window is reused per symbol — clicking the same coin a second time focuses the existing window rather than opening a new one
- Timeframe switcher (15m / 1H / 4H / 1D) inside the chart window — reload in place without reopening

#### S/R Detection
- **Swing-pivot clustering** (`detect_support_resistance()` in `chart_context.py`) — identifies local highs/lows, clusters nearby pivots, and counts touches per level
- **Grey box rendering**: S/R levels are drawn as horizontal filled rectangles on a `<canvas>` overlay — opacity scales with touch count (lighter = fewer touches, darker = more tested)
- **Right-axis labels**: each level shows type (`S`/`R`) and touch count directly on the price axis
- S/R summary injected into all AI prompts (live position analysis, call analyzer) via `format_for_prompt()`

#### Trendline Detection
- **`detect_trendlines()`** in `chart_context.py` — finds ascending support lines and descending resistance lines using swing-pivot pairs; validates each pair (no candle violates the line within 0.5% tolerance)
- Up to 2 uptrend + 2 downtrend lines per chart
- Trendlines drawn as dashed diagonal lines: green for uptrend, red for downtrend
- Legend shows direction, touch count, and anchor price range

#### Liquidation Levels
- **Yellow dashed lines** on every chart showing where each open position would be liquidated
- Auto-populated from live positions data; passed to the chart window as URL params
- Labels show direction (Long/Short) and exact liquidation price

#### Chart Explorer (new nav module)
- **Dedicated page** — type any symbol, pick a timeframe, click Draw to render a full candlestick chart
- All S/R, trendlines, and liquidation overlays from live positions apply automatically
- **Indicator panel** below the chart: RSI, MACD signal, EMA stack alignment, Bollinger %B, ADX, Stoch RSI, ATR, Volume ratio — shown as metric cards with colour-coded values
- **Pop Out** button opens the current chart as a detached resizable window
- Symbol autocomplete populated from your full trade history

#### Canvas Overlay Architecture
- S/R boxes and liquidation lines rendered on an absolutely-positioned `<canvas>` on top of LightweightCharts — stays in sync with pan/zoom via `requestAnimationFrame` loop
- Loop auto-stops when the canvas is removed from the DOM (chart destroyed / TF switch)
- Price-scale area (right ~65px) deliberately left uncovered so axis labels remain readable

### v1.9 — Technical Analysis & AI Foundation
- **`chart_context.py`** — new module: pulls OHLCV candles from Bitget and computes a full indicator suite via `pandas-ta` (no extra API key needed — uses existing Bitget auth)
- **Indicators computed per symbol × timeframe**: RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9), EMA 20/50/200 + stack alignment, Bollinger Bands(20,2) with percentile position, Stochastic RSI(14), ADX(14) with +DI/−DI direction, ATR(14) as % of price, volume vs 20-period average, last 3 candle descriptions (bullish/bearish/doji)
- **Auto-injected into Live Position AI** (4H + 1D) — Claude now references indicators when recommending Hold / Adjust SL / Close Now
- **Auto-injected into Call Analyzer** (4H + 1D) — Claude cross-references the call with live technicals before scoring
- **10-minute in-memory cache** per (symbol, timeframe) — no repeated Bitget calls within a session
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/chart/indicators?symbol=BTCUSDT&timeframes=4H,1D`
- **`docs/RATING_CRITERIA.md`** — complete reference documenting every AI scoring and grading criterion used across all six systems
- **Bug fix**: `analyze_call()` missing `market_regime` parameter caused 500 error on every call analysis request
- `pandas` and `pandas-ta` added to `requirements.txt`
- **`ai_rulebook.py`** — new module: Claude analyses your entire trade history and synthesises 5–10 personalised rules (warnings, strengths, habits, calibration notes) backed by real numbers from your data
- **`trader_rulebook` DB table** — rules persisted in SQLite; auto-regenerated weekly by the background sync loop
- **Rulebook + calibration data + similar trades** injected into every AI prompt (live position analysis, call analyzer, AI advisor)
- **Edge Lab UI** — "Trader Rulebook" section with Generate/Update button; rules displayed as colour-coded cards with confidence level and trade count
- **New API endpoints**: `GET /api/rulebook`, `POST /api/rulebook/update`

### v1.8 — Architecture Refactor
- **Flask Blueprints** — `app.py` reduced from 1158 to 52 lines; all routes split into `routes/` by domain: `journal`, `analytics`, `calls`, `limits`, `live`, `sync`
- **`db_conn()` context manager** — every route now uses `with db_conn() as conn:`, guaranteeing connection close on exception. Added to `database.py`
- **CSS extracted** — `templates/index.html` no longer contains inline CSS; all styles moved to `static/style.css` (cacheable, easier to edit)
- **Shared helpers** — `helpers.py` provides `_ok()`, `_err()`, `_filters_from_args()` to all blueprints
- **`analyst` migration consolidated** — moved from `app.py` startup into `database.py → init_db()` with all other column migrations

### v1.7 — Trading Tools & Heatmap
- **Position Sizing Calculator** — inline in Call Analyzer: enter Entry + SL, risk % auto-populates from account equity, shows Position Size / Leverage / Risk Amount / Risk Distance. Auto-fills entry and SL after every call analysis.
- **Economic Calendar** — fetches this week's high-impact USD events (ForexFactory, no API key). Yellow warning banner on Live Positions when events fall today or tomorrow. 
- **Trade Heatmap** — 7×24 grid in Deep Dive showing win rate by open hour (UTC) and close day. Color-coded: green ≥65% · blue 50–64% · yellow 40–49% · red <40%. Cells need ≥3 trades to activate.
- **BTC Dominance** — added to Dashboard Market Pulse strip via CoinGecko free API. Rising dominance shown in red (bad for alts), falling in green.

### v1.6 — Market Intelligence & Strategy
- **Fear & Greed Index** — live 0-100 sentiment score from alternative.me shown in a Market Pulse strip on the Dashboard
- **Bitget Funding Rate** — per-symbol, shown as chip on every Live Positions card; injected into per-position Claude analysis
- **Bitget Long/Short Ratio** — retail positioning per symbol on Live Positions cards; injected into analysis
- All three sources feed Claude's trade grading, per-position analysis, and full AI Advisor
- New module `market_context.py` with 5-minute in-memory cache; new `GET /api/market/context?symbols=` endpoint
- **Analyst Leaderboard** — Edge Score (0-100) ranks analysts by composite metric: 50% trade win rate + 30% call outcome win rate + 20% TP1 hit rate. Color-coded rows, medal rankings, TP1 hit rate and conversion rate columns.
- **Correlation Detector** — groups open positions by sector (Bitcoin / ETH+L2 / SOL+L1 / Meme / DeFi / AI+Infra); two-tier severity: yellow (2 positions same sector/direction), red (3+)
- **AI Pattern Detector** — Claude analyses full trade history by setup type, session, weekday, direction, duration, grade; returns warnings, insights, and strengths

### v1.5 — Trading Precision & Edge Lab
- **AI Execution Grading** — click ⚡ Grade on any trade; Claude assigns A/B/C/D with a written explanation based on entry quality, exit discipline, and realized R:R
- **Setup Type Tagging** — label trades as Breakout, Pullback, Trend Continuation, Range Fade, Reversal, News/Event, or Other; Deep Dive shows P&L and win rate broken down by setup type
- **Planned vs Realized R:R** — link a trade to an analyst call; Deep Dive computes and displays planned R:R vs what was actually achieved
- **Edge Lab** — Deep Dive split into two pages; Edge Lab adds setup analysis, grade breakdown, pattern detector, R:R tracking
- **Setup Type filter in Journal** — filter by specific setup or ⚪ Untagged; setup captured in Add Trade modal for manual trades
- New backend module `ai_trade_grader.py`; new API routes `POST /api/positions/<id>/grade` and `GET /api/analytics/rr`

### v1.4 — Code Quality & Security
- `SECURITY.md` added — lightweight vulnerability reporting policy via GitHub private advisories
- CodeQL workflow added (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) — analysis now actually runs on push, PR, and weekly; branch protection is fully operational
- Frontend JS extracted from `templates/index.html` into `static/app.js` — `index.html` reduced from 3348 to 1078 lines
- Security fix: incomplete string escaping in `static/app.js` — backslashes now escaped before single quotes in analyst name interpolation (CWE-116)

### v1.3 — Repository Hardening
- Branch protection on `main` — CodeQL must pass before merge
- Dependabot weekly pip dependency updates
- Squash merge only — cleaner commit history
- LICENSE fixed to standard GPL v3 (was showing as unrecognised)
- Secret scanning alert resolved — old revoked API key removed from history
- Dependencies bumped: Flask 3.1.3, Anthropic SDK 0.100.0

### v1.2 — Security Fixes
- Stack trace exposure fixed — exception details no longer returned to the client (CWE-209)
- Path traversal fixed — uploaded filenames sanitized with `secure_filename` before use (CWE-022)
- SQL filter inputs now validated with an allowlist before reaching the query layer (CWE-089)

### v1.1 — Privacy, Fixes & Polish
